## Question 5
For my reference, I'd like to switch between different themes for my IDE. I learn from this [Twitter link](https://twitter.com/dataquestio/status/1270747709113274368) that I can change my theme appearances.

## Question 6
In my opinion, Fourth Circle: p Value Fishing is the hardest circle of scientific hell. It's tough because this is where ideas are truly implemented by using the appropriate analytic method. It's easy to have bias when finding appropriate analytic method while hunting p-Value and forgetting the goal of the analysis. Also, fishing for the best analytic method will possibly hitting dead-ends which creates frustration that would lead to enethical p-value fishing.

## Question 7
